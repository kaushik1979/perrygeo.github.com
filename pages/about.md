<p>
Welcome to my humble website/blog. My name is Matthew Perry. Here I'll ramble on about various experiments with geospatial technology: maps, GIS,  programming and general web tech.
</p>
<p>
I live in Portland, OR with my wife and a menagerie of pets. I spend my days at <a href="http://www.ecotrust.org/">Ecotrust</a> as an Applications Developer - working mostly on decision support tools for  natural resource management and the <a href="http://github.com/ecotrust/madrona">Madrona</a> web framework.
</p>
<p>
Besides my love of maps, I also spend a good deal of time cycling (commuting,MTB,road), running with my dog and spending time with my wife in those all-too-rare moments of free time. When I get a weekend off, you'll either find me backpacking or travelling to see some good live music.
