[Uncylopedia](http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/Main_Page), the self-proclaimed encyclopedia "full of misinformation and utter lies", has a hillarious [article about Geologists](http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/Geologist). I especially like the "[Geologist-Engineer Controversy](http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/Geologist#The_Great_Geologist-Engineer_Controversy)" which, having worked with both geologists and engineers extensively, is a pretty accurate portrayal of their respective approaches.



> Geology, being an art as much as a science, has always baffled and worried engineers, hence the engineers' defensive weapons of pocket protectors, slide rules, black socks, and eventually computers.





A related joke:



> A geologist and engineer walk into a job interview. They are each asked a simple math question : 'What is 2 times 2?'.  The engineer replies, 'It's 4.00000'. The geologist replies, 'Ah.. it's about 4'
