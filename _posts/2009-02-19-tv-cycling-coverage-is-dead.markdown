Real-time spatial application developers take note...

I've been following the Tour of California this week (looking forward to the Solvang Time Trial this Friday) and have been disappointed with the TV coverage on Versus. Its not that the coverage is bad, its just that long-distance endurance sports don't lend themselves to the traditional 2 announcers and 1 camera format. There are multiple groups of riders and so much spatial information to keep track of if one really wants to understand the dynamics of a cycling event.

Maybe I've just been spoiled by the [Amgen Tour Tracker](http://tracker.amgentourofcalifornia.com/). It is a crowning example of a spatially-aware real-time web application.

It provides two cameras of live coverage, live commentary with interviews, chat, summary updates, gps tracking of riders shown on both an elevation profile and a yahoo-based aerial map, "gps+" location prediction, race standings, time checks, etc. Far more information than any TV coverage without resorting to information overload.
