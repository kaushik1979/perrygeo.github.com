For the last year or so, I've had the pleasure of working with the [MarineMap Consortium](http://www.marinemap.org). We just learned yesterday that the U.S. Institute for Environmental Conflict Resolution [awarded](http://eon.businesswire.com/portal/site/eon/permalink/?ndmViewId=news_view&newsId=20100526007072&newsLang=en) MarineMap the “Innovation in Technology and Environmental Conflict Resolution”.



I joined the team after the launch of the [South Coast of California](http://southcoast.marinemap.org/marinemap/) site which was already widely recognized as a successful decision-support tool for marine spatial planning. We've since been working on version 2 of the MarineMap tool which is deployed currently for the [North Coast of California](http://northcoast.marinemap.org/marinemap) in support of their Marine Life Protection Act (MLPA) process. 

It's been a tremendous challenge to bring a [new version of the software](http://code.google.com/p/marinemap/) to life and have it meet and exceed the standards set by its predecessor. It has also been tremendously rewarding and having our work recognized at this level is a great honor. It's nice to know that the tools we've developed have been so helpful and instrumental in the marine planning process along the coast of California. Looking forward, I see MarineMap growing beyond a tool for a specific purpose (supporting the MLPA Initiative) to a robust framework for developing web-based spatial planning tools for all sorts of environmental applications, both marine and terrestrial. And this award confirms that we are already heading in the right direction. Very exciting news!
