I had previously [bitched and moaned](http://www.perrygeo.net/wordpress/?p=138) about the licensing restrictions on the [TrainingPeaks WKO+](http://www.trainingpeaks.com/WKO) software. Truth be told, the reason I was so put off by their crappy licensing scheme was that my cycling training relied so heavily on their software. It was not perfect but it was the best tool available. I've since discovered [Golden Cheetah](http://goldencheetah.org/) which is a viable open-source alternative but it still lags behind WKO+ in many critical features.

Now, fresh in time for the 2010 training season, Peaksware has released a new version 3.0 of WKO+ which, amongst many UI and functionality improvements, has made considerable progress on the licensing front.



> We know, our licensing has been a challenge to deal with for our customers in the past, but we’ve always tried to be as helpful as possible getting you back up and running after a hard drive crash or new computer. To remedy this, we’re pleased to announce an all new flexible licensing system. First, with every purchase we now allow you to install WKO+ 3.0 on up to two computers; second, we’ve built an online activation/deactivation system so you are free to move your active licenses from machine to machine. Are you leaving on a 2 week trip? Just de-activate your home computer, activate your laptop, and you’re on your way. When you get home, de-actiavate your laptop, re-activate your desktop and you’re all set.



It ain't open source (there is still a place in this world for proprietary software if they can push the boundaries and innovate) but the sensitivity to the licensing issue just may have restored my faith in their company.
