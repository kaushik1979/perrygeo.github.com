[FDO](http://fdo.osgeo.org/), [GDAL](http://gdal.osgeo.org/) and [FME](http://safe.com/products/fme/index.php) all seem to operate in roughly the same domain - Providing a data model, API and tools to translate between spatial data formats. Does anyone know of any good write-ups comparing/contrasting the features of these three libraries?
