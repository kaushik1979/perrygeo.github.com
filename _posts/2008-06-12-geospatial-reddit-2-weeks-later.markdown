So, despite frustrations with getting submitted URLs to appear, [Geospatial Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/geospatial/) is still puttering along. Not exactly a vibrant community _yet_ but there are currently 133 subscribers. If you're subscribed, take a minute to submit your favorite URLs. If you haven't subscribed, [check it out](http://www.reddit.com/r/geospatial/).

I thought 133 subscribers was a decent number until I found that the [Bacon subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/bacon/) has over 500. Apparently the world would rather discuss their greasy breakfast food than maps.
