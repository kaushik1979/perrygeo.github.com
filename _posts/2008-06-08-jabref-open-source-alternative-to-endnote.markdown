For those of you that use EndNote to keep track of your bibliographies/references , there is an alternative. [JabRef](http://jabref.sourceforge.net). I find the [UI](http://jabref.sourceforge.net/images/Jabref-ScreenShot-MainWindow.png) to be very intuitive and it has a range of customizable import/export formats. JabRef uses the [BibTex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX) format as it's native file format so, of course, it integrates very well with [LaTeX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX).

One of the neat features is the ability to create custom bibliographies in HTML, complete with javascript-based search capabilities. Here's [my reference list](http://perrygeo.net/references.html) which I'll be slowly adding to as I convert all my old text-based and EndNote reference lists over.
