title: Geospatial Reddit - A democratic solution to geo blog overload?
wpid: '123'

All the great GIS news/blog aggregators out there (planetgs, slashgeo, etc) are moderator driven - a few people act as the gatekeepers and inevitably [have to decide what information is useful](http://www.spatiallyadjusted.com/2008/05/23/planet-geospatial-reboot-coming/). This is [not the ideal way](http://zcologia.com/news/762/planet-geospatial/) to do things. 

There's a more democratic and distributed way to spread the role - it's called _reddit_. ![](http://reallystatic.reddit.com/static/create-a-reddit.png)  More specifically, [Geospatial Reddit](http://reddit.com/r/geospatial). For those unfamiliar with reddit (or similar sites like digg), the idea is simple: users submit stories and users vote on stories. The most popular ones rise to the top and, theoretically, the best articles magically appear on the front page. Much like democracy itself, there are flaws in the theory but its the best thing we've got.

Geospatial Reddit is public so sign up, submit your favorite stories and vote. Lets see if we can make this work.
