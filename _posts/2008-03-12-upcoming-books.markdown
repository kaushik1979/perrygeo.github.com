There are two new books coming out this summer which fill a valuable niche in the open-source GIS bookshelf:




  * 
[Applied Spatial Data Analysis with R](http://www.springer.com/statistics/statistical+theory+and+methods/book/978-0-387-78170-9)


  * [Desktop GIS: Mapping the Planet with Open Source](http://www.pragprog.com/titles/gsdgis)



These are both written by some of the top developers within their respective topics and I'm really looking forward to reading them.
