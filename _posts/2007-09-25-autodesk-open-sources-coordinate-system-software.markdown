Not very often do I see open source mentioned on the front page of my Google Finance page (let alone Geospatial Open Source). But here it is.. the announcement was made at FOSS4G2007 that [ autodesk will be open sourcing part of it's coordinate system and map projection technology](http://money.cnn.com/news/newsfeeds/articles/prnewswire/AQTU16425092007-1.htm). 

So what motivation does Autodesk (or any other company) have to open source it's technology? An important line from Lisa Campbell, vice president, Autodesk Geospatial:



> "Our intent to contribute again to the open source community is a reflection of our customers' desire for faster innovation, more frequent product releases, and lower total cost of ownership."
