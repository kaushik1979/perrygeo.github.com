I'd like to have some interesting excuse as to why I haven't posted since last July. But I don't. 

I've since left my postion at NCEAS, started a new job at [Geosyntec](http://www.geosyntec.com) and have been keeping busy with life, love and the pursuit of happiness. Oh and GIS of course.

Anyway, I expect to be posting on a much more regular basis from here on (unless I get distracted again ;-) ).
