Ah the joys of living in southern california. The Zaca Lake fire has been burning since July 4th and recently [flared up again](http://independent.com/news/2007/aug/03/zaca-fire-explodes/) with a shift in winds which is blowing ash and a very ominous plume of smoke all over downtown santa barbara. While it's still burning in the wilderness areas north of town, the Paradise Road area along the Santa Ynez river has been evacuated. [Check it out on google maps](http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&msid=105524280382284020010.0004351434f7c4b6bb5eb&ll=34.787162,-120.029583&spn=0.137739,0.144711&t=h&z=13&om=1).

The Santa Barbara News Press is reporting the fire has reached 39,000 acres and has cost $43 million thus far to contain. The county supervisors are likely to declare a state of emergency and there is already a health warning in effect. So much for my bike ride this afternoon...
