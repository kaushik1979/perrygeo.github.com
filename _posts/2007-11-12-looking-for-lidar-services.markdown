I'm looking for a LIDAR specialist to fly some sensors around San Diego. Ideally we would need someone who could collect both LIDAR data and digital aerial photography (high-res but only visible spectrum), process the data (generate bare-earth DEMs and georeferenced aerials) and deliver it in a GIS-compatible format.   This is in response to the recent fires related to erosion control.. with rainy season coming we'd be on a tight schedule.

Does anyone have any suggestions of good companies who could provide this service? Please feel free to recommend your own services if you think it would be a good fit.
