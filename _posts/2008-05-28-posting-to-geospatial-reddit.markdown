Some folks have had trouble submitting links so I figured I should post a bit more detail on that. To get articles to show up on the _geospatial_ reddit (not the main reddit), go to [http://reddit.com/r/geospatial/submit](http://reddit.com/r/geospatial/submit) or click the "Submit a Link" button on the right - from the geospatial page. When you're submitting the url, you should see "submit to geospatial" as the page header. 

I know at least 2 of us have been successful at posting. If this doesn't work for you, please let me know and I'll try and figure it out.
