Two weeks after I first noticed something had gone awry with the USGS Seamless site, they appear to have fixed their server issues. As of this morning, the interactive [data viewer and download interface](http://seamless.usgs.gov/website/seamless/viewer.php) is fully functionaly as far as I can tell. 

Now be gentle on their server. Rumour has it, if you download more than 3 DEMs at a time, the server might go down for another 2 weeks! Just kidding... everything seems to be working fine. Download away....
